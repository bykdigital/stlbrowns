Nap Lajoie, hardly behind by a hair, saw an opportunity — and so did Browns manager Jack O&rsquo;Connor, who happened to have it out for Cobb. O&rsquo;Connor ordered his third baseman to play deep on the grass for Lajoie, putting a perfect game well within reach. It was all Lajoie needed to surpass Cobb. In the end, Lajoie reached his last base on an error, giving Cobb the title he righteously earned. O&rsquo;Connor, and coach Harry Howell, who tried to bribe the official scorer out of the call, were fired from the Browns and never returned to the game.</p><p>Cobb&rsquo;s season was reinvestigated 70 years later. Sporting News historian Paul McFarlane found that he&rsquo;d been mistakenly credited for 2 hits — a difference that would&rsquo;ve given Lajoie the clear lead. Yet, the baseball commissioner at the time refused to strip Cobb of his honor, keeping Cobb&rsquo;s 9-season title streak in tact.</p>"

He was back in the game, and back to his old clever ways.</p><p>He famously had Harry Caray sing &ldquo;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&rdquo; during the 7th-inning stretch. He offered fans free admission after the White Sox were defeated 10-2 on Opening Day in 1979. He held Disco Demolition Night, which ended in a riot at Comiskey Park and a forfeit to the Tigers.</p><p>When the free agent era arrived, Veeck couldn&rsquo;t keep up financially, so he sold the White Sox in early 1981. But he didn&rsquo;t exit the game entirely. Fans spotted him frequently at Wrigley Field, cheering on the Cubs, as he&rsquo;d done in his childhood.</p><p>Veeck was inducted to the Hall of Fame in 1991, five years after his death. He earned this recognition not solely for his wild promotions, but for the lasting and positive impact his approach had on the game.

He strengthened his arm as a child by throwing rocks at birds he encountered while plowing the family's land. He also worked on mining and drilling sites as a youngster, which helped his conditioning. Waddell was a remarkably dominant strikeout pitcher in an era when batters mostly slapped at the ball to get singles. He had an excellent fastball, a sharp-breaking curve, a screwball, and superb control (his strikeout-to-walk ratio was almost 3-to-1). He led the major leagues in strikeouts for six consecutive years. </p>",

The pitching was so bad during the Browns&rsquo; lowly 1947 season, Dizzy would often remark in his broadcasts that he could do better. Six years removed from throwing in a game, Dizzy left his booth to be the Browns&rsquo; starting pitcher for the last game of the year. He pitched four shutout innings, and even got a hit, before leaving the game with a pulled muscle — the final injury of his playing career.</p>",

He made crowd-pleasing, game-saving catches. He was an all-around clutch player. As one reporter put it, &ldquo;He runs in the outfield like a deer, on the bases like an express train, and he throws like a rifle.&rdquo;</p><p>Unfortunately, Rivera&rsquo;s spunk and style didn&rsquo;t outweigh his early-season slump. He was traded back to the White Sox, and continued to make the news for the next 10 years.</p>",

Fans can reminisce at the team’s on-field antics and St. Louis’s original baseball rivalry. Those unfamiliar with the Browns will be introduced to characters like 3-foot-7-inch Eddie Gaedel, a surprise pinch-hitter wearing a batboy uniform with the number 1/8, and will quickly understand the undeniable lovability of this misfit franchise. Audiences everywhere will see that, beneath the tarnish, there is true baseball gold.<p>“The St. Louis Browns: The Team That Baseball Forgot” features archival photos and video footage of the Browns, discussions with St. Louis Browns Historical Society board members Bill Rogers and Emmett McAuliffe, and current interviews with some of the team’s last living players. The film follows the 2017 release of the critically acclaimed book, <i>St. Louis Browns: The Story of a Beloved Team</i>, by Bill Borst, Bill Rogers and Ed Wheatley, and the 2015 launch of our award-winning website.<p>So, tune in and watch as we take a look back and relive the story of what could have been, but never was — of baseball legends lost to time, glorious gimmicks and a beloved team turned fraternity of failure. This is the story of a team that found its place in history by losing its home. But thanks to this documentary, it\'s a story forgotten no more.'

Both American League and (especially importantly) New York Yankee attendance was falling in 1951, after robust postwar gains for several years. The baseball minions – and the press – decided that the very last thing the game needed was for a member of the laughingstock St. Louis Browns to win the MVP, and a pitcher at that.

Led by Mayor Francis Slay, the 1/8th-block-long parade started and ended in minutes. Attendees broke into applause when the parade halted at the entrance of the Tiny Bar.</p><p>Parade organizer Aaron Perlut &mdash; a founding partner of Elasticity, a digital marketing and public relations firm at 1010 Locust Street &mdash; helped open the Tiny Bar on May 27.

Due to the small size, the parade was dubbed a &quot;special event.&quot; Riordan said people who apply for parade permits generally do not ask to hold parades less than a block long.</p><p>&quot;It&rsquo;s definitely the smallest one anyone&rsquo;s called a parade,&quot; she said, noting that it might have been the shortest one in St. Louis history.</p><p>Travis Sheridan operated the 2010 yellow Smart car that was in the parade. He said he liked the atmosphere of the event. Music played while attendees milled around and ate birthday cake.</p><p>Sheridan said St. Louis might have an inferiority complex, but it shouldn&rsquo;t see itself as little. Small events like Monday&rsquo;s parade make Sheridan, a friend of Perlut&rsquo;s, optimistic about the future of the city that he moved to about three years ago.</p><p>&quot;People doing tiny things can have a big impact for St. Louis,&quot; Sheridan said.</p>'

				body: '<p>The book leads you on a journey through time as Gunderson takes you from Tommy&rsquo;s upbringing in Norristown, Pennsylvania to his continued service as an admirable baseball ambassador with the Dodgers. However, for a one-month period in 1953, Tommy was destined to be a starting pitcher for the St. Louis Browns.</p><p>Prior to the Browns final season in St. Louis in 1953, Bill Veeck acquired Lasorda for $50,000 from the Brooklyn Dodgers. Convinced that he was going to be able to move the team to Baltimore, Veeck began acquiring talent in anticipation of the move and the $2 million he was promised once he landed in Baltimore. But at this point, Veeck has made too many enemies throughout the league and his continual attempts to move were blocked by other owners determined to force him to sell the team. So, Veeck was obliged to return Lasorda back to the Dodgers during spring training.</p><p>Lasorda would go on to a dubious major league playing career followed by a Hall of Fame managerial career with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Tommy brought championships to Los Angeles in 1981 and 1988 and has served as one of the Dodgers and baseball&rsquo;s greatest champions. However, if not for financial issues and the hatred of Bill Veeck around the league, the man who famously said Dodger blue runs through his veins may, in fact, have bled brown.</p><p>Tommy was gracious enough to be the keynote speaker at the 2010 St. Louis Browns Historical Society luncheon.

				body: '<p>ST. LOUIS &mdash; As the Orioles embark on their 62nd season after abandoning St. Louis, The St. Louis Browns Historical Society, an organization dedicated to preserving the story and legacy of the St. Louis Browns baseball team, today announced the launch of its new website. St. Louis-based digital agency, HLK, developed the new site, <a href="www.thestlbrowns.com" target="_blank">www.thestlbrowns.com</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;What the Browns lacked in the win column, they more than made up for with peculiar happenings and stunts on the diamond, as well as various, records that will never be broken,&rdquo; said Emmett McAuliffe, Historical Society board member.  &ldquo;You could not write a Hollywood script better than what actually happened during the 52 years that this team tried to win games and attract fans on a shoestring budget.&rdquo;</p><p>The Browns Historical Society celebrated the launch of the new site yesterday at Tiny Bar in downtown St. Louis, Mo. A photo from the event can be found at <a href="http://bit.ly/1H7ZkNb" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1H7ZkNb</a> (from left to right: Joe Leahy, partner, HLK; Emmett McAuliffe, board member, Browns Historical Society; Bill Rogers, president, Browns Historical Society; and Eric Karlovic, partner, HLK).</p><p>Featuring an enhanced experience, the site includes a comprehensive overview of the franchise&rsquo;s storied history, biographies and statistics on St. Louis Browns players, and information about the Society and its members.</p><p>&ldquo;At HLK we believe, it is essential to preserve history through digital channels,&rdquo; noted Eric Karlovic, partner at St. Louis-based digital agency HLK. &ldquo;This site was designed in a meaningful storytelling style and experience that will appeal to existing fans and open an avenue to new audiences so the team and players are never forgotten.&rdquo;</p><p>The site launch is the first tactic of a larger strategy for the Society to preserve and remember the St. Louis Browns history, as well as create interest and increase membership in the Society, including the introduction of new merchandise and a documentary, which are set to launch over the next year.</p><p>The Browns moved to St. Louis in 1902, after playing as the Milwaukee Brewers for only one season, joining the already established Cardinals franchise in a baseball-crazy town. Named the Browns by owners, Robert Lee Hedges and the Orthwein brothers, Ralph and Max, the team reopened Sportsman&rsquo;s Park, which had previously served as home for the American Association St. Louis Browns (who one four-straight pennants).   In the Browns&rsquo; 52 years in St. Louis, the team finished sixth or worse in the American League 33 times and had 41 losing seasons, making the phrase &ldquo;St. Louis. First in shoes, first in booze, and last in the American League&rdquo; popular among the locals.</p><p>Along with a losing record the franchise was often  plagued with poor attendance, with the 1935 season only drawing 80,922 total fans to home games. The Browns had many memorable and notable players, and 13 future Hall of Famers would play for the club at one point in their careers, including George Sisler and Bobby Wallace.</p><p>The franchise played in the World Series only once,  in 1944; however, this success did not come without criticism, as most clubs during the time had lost many of their best players to fight in World War II. The Browns lost the Series to the Cardinals, and within three years, the team was back to last place in the American League.</p><p>Following a string of short-lived owners, the Browns were sold to the colorful Bill Veeck, , who would stop at nothing to attract fans with creative promotions. For his first game as the team&rsquo;s owner, Veeck offered all attendees a free beer or soda. Then, on August 19, 1951, Veeck had 3-foot-7-inch Eddie Gaedel, wearing a batboys&rsquo; uniform, pinch hit. Veeck took a $1,000,000 life insurance policy on Gaedel and threatened his life if he tried to swing at a pitch.</p><p>Although he had some valiant efforts, Veeck was unsuccessful in drawing a crowd and eventually sold the team to a Baltimore attorney at the end of the 1953 season. The club played its last game in St. Louis to a crowd of only 3,174 fans before moving to Baltimore to become the Orioles.</p> <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been over a century since the Browns played their first game in St. Louis, and the Historical Society is dedicated to keeping all of the great, and not so great, moments of the team&rsquo;s history alive,&rdquo; said Bill Rogers, president of the St. Louis Browns Historical Society. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to give fans a new way to learn about and remember the Browns.&rdquo;</p><h3>About the St. Louis Browns Historical Society</h3><p>The St. Louis Browns Historical Society and Fan Club is an organization dedicated to preserving every stat and story of the franchise, so that the history of baseball&rsquo;s most intriguing underdogs can continue to entertain fans.

				excerpt: "We present now for your amusement, the curious case of one Joe Blong. St. Louis Brown Stockings right-handed pitcher, St. Louis native, son of Irish immigrants, and University of Notre Dame alumnus.",
				body: '<p>He holds the major league record for most innings pitched without allowing a home run in a career (320.1 innings). But it also seems he had a nasty habit of throwing games, &ldquo;hippodroming&rdquo; as the newspapers of the day colorfully called it, and was kicked out of baseball for it not once but twice.</p><p>When Joe and two other Browns teammates were kicked out of baseball and blacklisted from all respectable leagues in November 1877, it was curtains for repeat-offender Blong. How do you develop a reputation for throwing games and still hold a positive record that lasts forever? Perhaps he had so much pitching control that he was able to serve up only singles and doubles so that it did not look too obvious that he was throwing a game? In that case, still remarkable control for a pitcher.</p><p>The modern record is quite a ways off from Blong&rsquo;s mark: (269.1 Greg Minton, San Francisco Giants reliever - June 1, 1979 through May 1, 1982), symptomatic of home runs that happen about 8 times as often as they did in the eighteen seventies. But nonetheless even if someday someone surpasses 320.1 innings, it is not likely to represent the entire career of that pitcher. Organized baseball did not know what a favor they were doing for Joe when they expelled him in 1877: bestowing him with an almost impossible record of pitching an entire career, consisting of more than 300 innings, without giving up a home run.</p><p>Blong is buried in Calvary Cemetery in north St. Louis.</p><p>p.s. for Notre Dame fans, one of Blong&rsquo;s partners in crime was the unfortunately named ballplayer Trick McSorley, his classmate at Notre Dame.</p><p>Here is the account from <a href="http://thisgameofgames.blogspot.com/2007/09/joe-blong.html" target="_blank">This Game of Games</a> blog.</p>'

				excerpt: "Major League Baseball fans in Illinois are divided into several camps. Cardinals fans rule the south, while White Sox fans creep in farther north. The Cubs have a strong base statewide. Sixty years ago, there was another, more interesting choice.",
				body: '<p>Until 1953, St. Louis was home to two teams, the National League&lsquo;s Cardinals as well as the Browns of the American League. Though the Browns lost a bundle of games over the decades, they left a legacy of some of baseball&rsquo;s most colorful moments.</p><p>The Browns opened play in St. Louis in 1902, a year after the founding of the American League, when the last-place Milwaukee franchise moved to the Gateway City after only one season. They were named for the color of their uniforms, which were replete with brown trim. The name also had been an early moniker of the other team in town, the Cardinals, before the turn of the century.</p><p>The Browns finished second at 78-58 in that inaugural season, which was not a sign of things to come. In their 52 years in St. Louis, the Browns finished first once, second twice and sixth or worse 33 times. Their ineptitude gave rise to the saying, &ldquo;St. Louis. First in shoes, first in booze and last in the American League.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite their struggles, the Browns never lacked for color. The team gave rise to the brilliant career of Branch Rickey, who came to St. Louis in 1913 from a successful stint as head baseball coach at the </p><p>University of Michigan. Rickey later moved across town and built the first minor-league farm system, which helped the Cardinals win four World Series titles before he left in 1942 for Brooklyn. There, he introduced Jackie Robinson, the first African-American to play in the major leagues.</p><p>&ldquo;The owner of the Browns at the time did not recognize Rickey&rsquo;s value,&rdquo; said Bill Rogers, of St. Louis, who has researched the Browns extensively. &ldquo;Had Rickey stayed on, I think things would have turned out much differently.&rdquo;</p><p>Rickey also is responsible for the player that many believe was the greatest in Browns history. First baseman George Sisler was a former Michigan star who batted .420 with 51 stolen bases and 105 RBIs in 1922 to lead the Browns to a 93-61 record, their best ever. Sisler batted .340 in a 15-year major league career, 12 with the Browns. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939.</p><p>Poor attendance was a recurring theme in Browns history. The 1935 team drew 80,922 fans for the entire season, and the Great Depression was not entirely to blame. St. Louis never won more than 67 games in a 154-game season at any point in the 1930s and was a miserable 43-111 in 1939.</p><p>Finally, the Browns broke through in 1942, finishing third at 82-69 under manager Luke Sewell.</p><p>With a strong pitching staff and a formidable infield, St. Louis was primed for a run. In 1944, they remained in contention for most of the season and swept a season-ending, four-game series against the Yankees at home to capture the pennant with an 89-65 mark.</p><p>Ironically, their World Series opponents were their crosstown rivals, the Cardinals. Since the early 1920s, the Browns actually had been the Cardinals&rsquo; landlords as the owners of Sportsmans&rsquo; Park. Unfortunately for the Browns, they had to suffer as the Cardinals rose to the top of the National League and routinely outdrew their counterparts at the box office.</p><p>The Browns jumped to a 2-1 Series lead, but the Cardinals won the last three to clinch in six games. &ldquo;The Series appearance was a tremendous shot in the arm for the Browns,&rdquo; said Rogers. &ldquo;But in St. Louis, the fans of one team did not like the other team. Even Stan Musial remarked about that once.&rdquo;</p><p>The Browns nearly repeated in 1945, but were eliminated from the pennant race on the last day of the season. That year, the star attraction for the Browns was Pete Gray, a one-armed outfielder who batted .218 in 77 games in his sole major league season.</p><p>For most of their existence, the Browns were financially strapped, and often had to sell off star players simply to keep afloat. After their glorious run of the mid-1940s, many top players were sold for needed cash, and the team fell into steep decline.</p><p>&ldquo;I hate to say it, but I think the Browns were often mismanaged,&rdquo; remarked Rogers. &ldquo;That put them in a financial bind often, and they had to trade or sell their best players to cover expenses.&rdquo;</p><p>However, there were plenty of memorable episodes. Many were courtesy of the flamboyant Bill Veeck, who bought the team in 1951 from an ownership tandem including Bill DeWitt, whose son is a current Cardinals&rsquo; team owner. Veeck challenged the Cardinals head on with a series of wacky promotions.</p><p>Soon after buying the team, Veeck signed Eddie Gaedel, a three-foot-seven-inch midget to a one-day contract and sent him up to bat in the second game of an Aug. 19, 1951, doubleheader against Detroit. Wearing the number &ldquo;1/8" and creating a strike zone of a mere inch-and-a-half, Gaedel walked on four pitches.</p><p>Six days later, the Browns hosted &ldquo;Grandstand Manager&rsquo;s Night,&rdquo; in which fans were allowed to make on-field decisions. Manager Zack Taylor held up signs such as &ldquo;Should the Browns Bunt?,&rdquo; &ldquo;Take Out the Pitcher?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Steal?,&rdquo; while spectators held signs replying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The Browns knocked off the Philadelphia A&rsquo;s 5-3 that night, a highlight for a squad that went 52-102.</p><p>Still, many of the players preferred playing for the Browns than the other team in town. Though the Cardinals never finished lower than second from 1941-49, many Browns were happier with their cellar-dwelling franchise. In an interview for a 2000 book, Don Gutteridge, a former Cardinal who was the Browns&rsquo; second baseman through their 1940s heyday, said that &ldquo;the Cardinals were always pinching pennies. The Browns were a better club to play for than the Cardinals.&rdquo;</p><p>Some of the later Browns are among the franchise&rsquo;s most recognizable names. They include the legendary Satchel Paige, who won 12 games at age 46 in 1952, as well as righthander Ned Garver, who won 20 games in 1951. Garver is one of 23 surviving Browns players today, a list that includes Ottawa native Ed Mickelson, who saw action in seven games for the Browns in 1953 and is said to have driven in the final run in Browns history.</p><p>Mickelson, now 88, played in a total of 18 Major League games over three seasons with the Browns, White Sox and Cardinals and later wrote a memoir of his 11 seasons in pro ball, mostly in the minors.</p><p>Another surviving ex-Brown is Don Larsen, a St. Louis rookie in 1953. Three years later, he tossed a perfect game for New York in the 1956 World Series.</p><p>When the Cardinals were sold to Anheuser-Busch in December 1952, Veeck realized he could no longer survive against a larger-budget rival. His tumultuous run as Browns&rsquo; owner came to an end when he sold the team after the 1953 season. The franchise moved to Baltimore and became the Orioles.</p><p>Sixty years later, the Browns are hardly forgotten. In 1984, the St. Louis Browns Fan Club was founded and now numbers 370 members. The club holds an annual banquet, publishes an in-house magazine and offers a line of collectibles.</p><p>&ldquo;Interest in the Browns is extremely high,&rdquo; said Rogers, the president of the club. &ldquo;Even though only 23 Browns survive, there are tens of thousands of fans left. Even younger people have experienced the Browns through the memories of their parents and grandparents. Like one person said to me, &lsquo;we can&rsquo;t bring back the Browns, but we can at least keep their memory alive.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>'
